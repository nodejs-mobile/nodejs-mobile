## Project Goals

1. To provide the fixes necessary to run Node.js on mobile operating systems.
1. To investigate which features need to be added to Node.js in order to make it a useful tool for mobile app development.
1. To diverge as little as possible from nodejs/node, while fulfilling goals (1) and (2).

## Download

Binaries for Android and iOS are available at https://github.com/nodejs-mobile/nodejs-mobile/releases.
