# Node.js Core Tests

This directory contains code and data used to test the Node.js implementation.

For a detailed guide on how to write tests in this
directory, see [the guide on writing tests](../doc/contributing/writing-tests.md).

On how to run tests in this directory, see
[the contributing guide](../doc/contributing/pull-requests.md#step-6-test).

For the tests to run on Windows, be sure to clone Node.js source code with the
`autocrlf` git config flag set to true.
