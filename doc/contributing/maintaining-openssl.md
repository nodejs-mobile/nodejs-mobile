# Maintaining OpenSSL

This document describes how to update `deps/openssl/`.

If you need to provide updates across all active release lines you will
currently need to generate three PRs as follows:

* a PR for `main` which is generated following the instructions
  below for OpenSSL 3.x.x.
* a PR for 16.x following the instructions in the v16.x-staging version
  of this guide.
* a PR for 14.x following the instructions in the v14.x-staging version
  of this guide.
* a PR which uses the same commit from the second PR to apply the
  updates to the openssl source code, with a new commit generated
  by following steps 2 onwards on the 12.x line. This is
  necessary because the configuration files have embedded timestamps
  which lead to merge conflicts if cherry-picked from the second PR.

## Use of the quictls/openssl fork

Node.js currently uses the quictls/openssl fork, which closely tracks
the main openssl/openssl releases with the addition of APIs to support
the QUIC protocol.

Details on the fork, as well as the latest sources, can be found at
<https://github.com/quictls/openssl>.

Branches are used per OpenSSL version (for instance,
<https://github.com/quictls/openssl/tree/OpenSSL_1_1_1j+quic>).

## Requirements

* Linux environment.
* `perl` Only Perl version 5 is tested.
* `nasm` (<https://www.nasm.us/>) Version 2.11 or higher is needed.
* GNU `as` in binutils. Version 2.26 or higher is needed.

## 0. Check requirements

```console
% perl -v

This is perl 5, version 22, subversion 1 (v5.22.1) built for
x86_64-linux-gnu-thread-multi
(with 60 registered patches, see perl -V for more detail)

% as --version
GNU assembler (GNU Binutils for Ubuntu) 2.26.1
Copyright (C) 2015 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
...
% nasm -v
NASM version 2.11.08
```

## 1. Obtain and extract new OpenSSL sources

Get a new source from <https://github.com/quictls/openssl/tree/OpenSSL_1_1_1j+quic>
and copy all files into `deps/openssl/openssl`. Then add all files and commit
them. (The link above, and the branch, will change with each new OpenSSL
release).

```console
% git clone https://github.com/quictls/openssl
% cd openssl
% git checkout OpenSSL_1_1_1j+quic
% cd ../node/deps/openssl
% rm -rf openssl
% cp -R ../../../openssl openssl
% rm -rf openssl/.git* openssl/.travis*
% git add --all openssl
% git commit openssl
```

The commit message can be written as (with the openssl version set
to the relevant value):

```text
deps: upgrade openssl sources to OpenSSL_1_1_1j

This updates all sources in deps/openssl/openssl by:
    $ git clone https://github.com/quictls/openssl
    $ cd openssl
    $ git checkout OpenSSL_1_1_1j+quic
    $ cd ../node/deps/openssl
    $ rm -rf openssl
    $ cp -R ../openssl openssl
    $ rm -rf openssl/.git* openssl/.travis*
    $ git add --all openssl
    $ git commit openssl
```

## 2. Execute `make` in `deps/openssl/config` directory

Use `make` to regenerate all platform dependent files in
`deps/openssl/config/archs/`:

```console
# On non-Linux machines
% make gen-openssl

# On Linux machines
% make -C deps/openssl/config
```

**Note**: If the 32-bit Windows is failing to compile run this workflow instead:

```console
% make -C deps/openssl/config clean
# Edit deps/openssl/openssl/crypto/perlasm/x86asm.pl changing
# #ifdef to %ifdef to make it compatible to nasm on 32-bit Windows.
# See: https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/43603#issuecomment-1170670844
# Reference: https://github.com/openssl/openssl/issues/18459
```

## 3. Check diffs

Check diffs to ensure updates are right. Even if there are no updates in openssl
sources, `buildinf.h` files will be updated because they have timestamp
data in them.

```console
% git diff -- deps/openssl
```

_Note_: On Windows, OpenSSL Configure generates a `makefile` that can be
used for the `nmake` command. The `make` command in step 2 (above) uses
`Makefile_VC-WIN64A` and `Makefile_VC-WIN32` that are manually
created. When source files or build options are updated in Windows,
it needs to change these two Makefiles by hand. If you are not sure,
please ask @shigeki for details.

## 4. Commit and make test

Update all architecture dependent files. Do not forget to git add or remove
files if they are changed before committing:

```console
% git add deps/openssl/config/archs
% git add deps/openssl/openssl/include/crypto/bn_conf.h
% git add deps/openssl/openssl/include/crypto/dso_conf.h
% git add deps/openssl/openssl/include/openssl/opensslconf.h
% git commit
```

The commit message can be written as (with the openssl version set
to the relevant value):

### OpenSSL 1.1.1

```text
 deps: update archs files for OpenSSL-1.1.1

 After an OpenSSL source update, all the config files need to be
 regenerated and committed by:
    $ make -C deps/openssl/config
    $ git add deps/openssl/config/archs
    $ git add deps/openssl/openssl/include/crypto/bn_conf.h
    $ git add deps/openssl/openssl/include/crypto/dso_conf.h
    $ git add deps/openssl/openssl/include/openssl/opensslconf.h
    $ git commit
```

### OpenSSL 3.0.0

```text
deps: update archs files for quictls/openssl-3.0.0-alpha-16

After an OpenSSL source update, all the config files need to be
regenerated and committed by:
    $ make -C deps/openssl/config
    $ git add deps/openssl/config/archs
    $ git add deps/openssl/openssl
    $ git commit
```

Finally, build Node.js and run the tests.
