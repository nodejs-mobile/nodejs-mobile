# Contributing to Node.js for Mobile Apps

## Code Contributions
Only changes that fall within the scope of the [project goals](https://github.com/janeasystems/nodejs-mobile/blob/mobile-master/README.md#project-goals) will be accepted. 

If you want to implement a major feature or a semantical change, please open an issue for discussion first. For minor fixes, feel free to just open a pull request.

### Commit guidelines
Please ensure that commits messages adhere to the [Node.js commit message guidelines](https://github.com/nodejs/node/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit-message-guidelines).

Platform-specific fixes for Android or iOS should be implemented in separate commits, and the titles of those commits should include `android` or `ios` in the list of affected subsystems.
